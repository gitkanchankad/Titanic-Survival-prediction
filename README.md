ðŸš¢ Predicting Titanic Survival: A Data Science Exploration ðŸŒŠ
I built a model to predict whether a passenger survived or not using Python. The journey involved:
âœ… Data Cleaning and Exploration: Handling missing values, analyzing survival trends by gender, age, and class.
âœ… Feature Engineering: Encoding categorical variables and visualizing survival rates for actionable insights.
âœ… Key observations:
Survival rates were higher for females compared to males.
First-class passengers had better chances of survival compared to other classes.
âœ… Tools Used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and other Python libraries.

This project honed my skills in exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and data visualization. It's fascinating how historical data can be analyzed for predictive
